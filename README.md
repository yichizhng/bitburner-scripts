# bitburner-scripts

A collection of some bitburner scripts

## autokroos.js

An IPvGO script which plays 5x5 boards against Illuminati, though you can easily change it to play other opponents. (I suggest turning USE_AI_TWEAKS off if you do; it knows
Illuminati AI priorities and will exploit them mercilessly). If you want higher winrate at the cost of longer thinking time, try increasing PLAYOUTS to 30000.

## noob.js
A non-formulas HWGW shotgun batcher. Optimized for low ram cases; at high ram it might freeze up your system (especially if hack time is low)

## pro.js
A formulas HGW batcher with lots of fancy features.

## fuzzy.js
A NS proxy for people who aren't very good at typing.

## roulette.js
A manual roulette cheat

## stonks.js
Improvement on xsinx's stock script; still doesn't do flip cycle detection.
